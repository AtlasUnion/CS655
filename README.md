# CS655

Hey, I uploaded the worker in a separate branch. There's another file I was using just for testing, we can remove it from the final build. Currently, the worker expects a message of the form "{'hash': <hash in base64>, 'index': [<start_index>,<end_index>]}END". For example, "{'hash': b'/JPSe2O0LRk+fyvduXBZsA==', 'index': [0,250000]}END" looks for a password that hashes to b'/JPSe2O0LRk+fyvduXBZsA==' and will search passwords from index 0 up to but not including 250000. Format was just something arbitrary and can be easily tweaked, just let me know if you have any changes to it. Oh and the END portion is just so I know when the full string was received.
